# How to Add Your School Logo

To display your school logo in the sidebar:

1. **Prepare your logo image**:
   - Save your school logo as `school-logo.png`
   - Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger (square format works best)
   - Supported formats: PNG, JPG, or JPEG

2. **Upload the logo**:
   - Create a folder: `public/images/` (if it doesn't exist)
   - Place your logo file in: `public/images/school-logo.png`

3. **The sidebar will automatically**:
   - Display your logo if the file exists
   - Show a default graduation cap icon if the logo file is not found

4. **File path structure**:
   ```
   RMS/
   ├── public/
   │   └── images/
   │       └── school-logo.png  ← Place your logo here
   ```

The logo will appear as a circular image in the sidebar header next to "RMS".
